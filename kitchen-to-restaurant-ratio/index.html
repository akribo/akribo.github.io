Khema Phnom Penh From travelfish.org
According to a recent poll, which surveyed more than 700 restaurants in the united states, the average size of a commercial kitchen is 1,051 square feet. The industry rule of thumb is that 40% of your space goes to the kitchen storage and prep areas, so you�d have 1,600 square feet for business and 2,400 square feet for your patrons. That’s why it’s so important to get the ratio right for your restaurant. Add additional expense lines for disposables and retail cogs if applicable.
