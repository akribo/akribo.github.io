<meta name="description" content="Do I Want A Sink In My Kitchen Island, If you’re not a big cook then “island drafts” can work ok, but they’re really not meant for serious cooking. Adding a kitchen island is an ideal way to handle storage for accessories in your kitchen.
I�ve always said I want an area my children can sit at and From pinterest.com
I like to have the fridge then sink then stove with counter space between each for efficient food preparation. I have ample counter space on each side of the sink for food prep and even more counter space on each side of the oven. In my kitchen, one of the sinks is on the island and the oven is directly behind me along the back perimeter. You don’t want the sink all the way to the edge of the island.
