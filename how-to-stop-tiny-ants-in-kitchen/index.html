7 Ways to Get Rid of Ants With Natural Ant Killers Tiny From tr.pinterest.com
Like all living creatures, ants need water, food, and shelter for survival. Make your kitchen inhospitable to ants by coating previous ant entry points with homemade ant repellents such as two tablespoons of peppermint oil and a quart of water, equal parts apple cider. Not only do the herbs and spices keep ants out of the kitchen, but they give the room a pleasant aroma. If you spritz them with a repellent, like lemon spray or ammonia, it’ll kill a few and repel the rest, which can just cause them to scatter.
