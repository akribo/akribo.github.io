ABC Kitchen Review and Photos New York, NY Eatosaurus Rex From eatosaurusrex.com
For appetizer i chose the peekytoe crab toast and my friend decided on the kale salad with asparagus. We started with drinks, a sparkling strawberry cocktail and rhubarb lavender fizz. But, like almost everything on the menu at this inventive new restaurant, it works. Incredibly warm place for a birthday meal, particularly after age 30 :) food was exceptional but we waited for over two hours for our food and service was friendly but basic and could have been better.
