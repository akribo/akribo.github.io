KitchenAid KSM5GB 5 Qt. Glass Mixing Bowl with Handle and From webstaurantstore.com
Look for a tiny screw on the head of your kitchenaid, and turn it a little bit at a time until the mixer has proper clearance. The reason you may have to adjust your mixer is that during the manufacturing process, kitchenaid stand mixers are set for the beaters to just clear the bowl when mixing. Since mixers need to have grease to do their job properly, the manufacturer made sure to include an oil supply to each mixer that will last for a lifetime. If the beaters of your kitchenaid mixer hit the bottom of the bowl or it�s not mixing properly, then it’s your machine�s fault.
