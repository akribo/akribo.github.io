Refurbished KitchenAid Mixers Make it Easy to Buy a Mixer From wideopeneats.com
There are quite a few models like the djx350bl or the djx350wbl with red colored trim that have remarkable performance for their low price tag. Here, you’ll find special offers on the iconic kitchenaid® stand mixer and other countertop appliances, including blenders, food processors and choppers, hand. The tilt head might have been nicer, but the bowl up/down lever works because the mixer fits under our upper cabinets without having to pull it out. As with other appliances, ebay or craigslist is a good place to buy used kitchenaid appliances, but amazon sells refurbished kitchenaid stand mixers at a discount.
